    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Understanding and proper implementation of standards. Another word for compliance is amenability. When you want to ensure compliance, you would need to ensure that your standards are correct and address your policies and any applicable regulations as well.Adherence to recommendations from senior management is incorrect. Adherence to recommendations from senior management would not ensure compliance, unless the recommendations reflect standards.  There is too much “unknown” here to select this answer as the best choice.Review audit reports is incorrect. So, when we think of compliance, we think of audits.  But how does reviewing an audit ensure compliance?  The review is one aspect, the implementation/correction is another.Comprehensive acceptable use policies is incorrect. An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a document stipulating constraints and best practice that users must adhere too.  This would not ensure compliance with anything other than perhaps what is stipulated in the AUP.",

White listing is a method used to allow only a list of approved software from being utilized.  However, it would not stop a person from utilizing a pirated version of that approved software.Establish a black list of non-approved software is incorrect. Black listing is a method used to not allow all software “black listed”.  This is much harder to implement than a white list as it would require a quite extensive list.  It would also not stop a person from utilizing a pirated version of any software that was approved.Purchase COTS (commercial off the shelf software) with active scanning of all software assets installed. is incorrect. The utilization of COTS with active scanning wouldn’t really reduce risk.  This option would be used mostly as a detective control.",

Both the token and the server run on autonomous clocks that synchronize to the same server. The OTP that is created is only valid for a period of time.Complex password with Multi-Factor Authentication is incorrect. A complex password is considered type 1 (something you know), but it would in general not be one time, as that would require extreme overhead and could cause passwords to be less secure (see NIST-800-63b).  Multi-factor authentication would require more than one factor to authenticate, for example a password and a security token.  Due to the multiple methods involved, it is not a good example of an OTP.Location and time-based authorization via geo-location is incorrect. Location and time-based authorization via geo-location would not be an example of an OTP.  ABAC (attribute-based access control) is a good example of where geo-location or time of day is utilized.  Essentially, a user is authorized based on predetermined conditions such as a login from a particular IP address during a set hour.Fingerprint scanning is incorrect. Fingerprint scanning is considered a type3 biometrics mechanism (something you are).  It would not be considered an OTP as a fingerprint generally will never change.",

Implementing an IDPS connected inline would function as an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS).  This  is effective at detecting and blocking malicious traffic in real time. An IPS can mitigate certain types of DoS attacks by identifying and preventing known malicious patterns. \nAn application proxy to monitor and thwart any inbound connections through the utilization of AI (Artificial Intelligence). is incorrect. While application proxies operate at the application layer and can manage external access by filtering requests, they are primarily designed to handle user-level traffic rather than prevent large-scale denial of service (DoS) attacks. Application proxies often mask internal systems by reassigning outgoing traffic to appear as though it originated from the proxy, which can offer some security. However, they are not the most effective solution for directly mitigating DoS attacks, especially those targeting network-level vulnerabilities.\nImplement a SIEM (security incident event manager) to capture and learn about malicious attacks is incorrect. A SIEM provides an automated log review and provides real-time analysis but does not scan outgoing traffic. It would not stop malicious activity.\nImplement a stateful firewall to block malicious traffic is incorrect. A stateful firewall evaluates the network traffic by examining source and destination addresses, application usage, and source. They do have the ability to actively watch for and block unauthorized users and activities, but they would not be the best method to prevent a DOS here.",

An NBA can analyze information from a wide range of sources and use machine learning to identify patterns that could suggest an attack is taking place.Circuit Proxy is incorrect. A circuit proxy works at the session layer of the OSI model and monitors traffic but cannot explore the contents of a packet like an application proxy could.  Therefore, it cannot perform deep packet inspection.Padded Cell is incorrect. A padded cell is similar to a honeypot.  A padded cell has the look and layout of the actual network, but within the padded cell the intruder can neither perform malicious activities nor access any confidential data.  A padded cell is a simulated environment that may offer fake data to retain an intruder’s interest.Signature based Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) is incorrect. An IPS is a network security technology that examines network traffic flows in order to detect and prevent vulnerability exploits. A signature based IPS uses predefined signatures of well-known network threats. When an attack is initiated that matches one of these signatures, the system takes appropriate action.  The attack is unknown which would make an IDS ineffective.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Implement a VPN (Virtual private network) with IPSEC utilizing ESP (Encapsulation security payload).  ESP is an element of IPSEC that provides encryption to protect the confidentiality of transmitted data.  ESP is the part of IPsec that provides encryption, ensuring the confidentiality of the data transmitted over the VPN. ESP also offers data integrity and optional authentication, making it a comprehensive solution for securing communication between two networks. \nImplement a VPN (Virtual private network) with IPSEC (internet protocol security) utilizing AH (Authentication header). is incorrect.  AH (Authentication Header) is part of IPsec and provides integrity and authentication for the data being transmitted, it does not provide encryption. AH ensures that the data has not been tampered with and verifies the identity of the sender, but it does not protect the confidentiality of the data. Since the question is about facilitating a secure connection between two networks, encryption (which ensures confidentiality) is critical. ESP (Encapsulation Security Payload) is needed for encryption, which is why this option is not the best choice.\nImplement a VPN (Virtual private network) with IPSEC (internet protocol security) utilizing both AH (Authentication header) and ESP (Encapsulation security payload). is incorrect.  sing both AH and ESP would provide both authentication, integrity, and encryption, it's not the most efficient or commonly recommended option. ESP by itself already provides encryption, authentication, and integrity protection. Adding AH on top of that is typically redundant. In most cases, ESP alone is sufficient for providing both encryption and integrity\nImplement a VPN (Virtual private network) connected to a bastion host which would act as the intermediary device between the two networks. is incorrect.  While a bastion host can be used as an intermediary device for securing connections, it is not the best solution for creating a secure VPN connection between two networks. A bastion host is typically used to provide access to a specific service (like SSH or VPN) in a secure manner, but it is not necessary for securely connecting two networks. The focus of the question is on using IPsec for secure communication, and IPsec is specifically designed for this purpose, making a bastion host an unnecessary element in this context.",

Subsequently, the question is asking how best to project critical data. It does not indicate if it is confidentiality, integrity, or availability that has importance. Strong access controls are the best solution here as it can help protect critical data by limiting access, controlling alteration, and thwarting destruction.

Kevin is looking for prompt delivery and high availability to a dispersed set of customers, albeit a small group of them.Create, maintain, and distribute duplicative data across all facets to meet requirements. is incorrect. While this could help ensure availability it would not be the BEST solution as it would require a lot of overhead, i.e. ensure all the data is the same, test the data, and distribute.Implement a load balancing schema to help mitigate availability issues is incorrect. While a load balancer would help with service issues it is not the best answer. A load balancer effectively splits the load of traffic among multiple servers so that the same information is served to clients without causing service downtime.   Because the users are geographically dispersed, a CDN is the better solution.  Also, a load balancing solution would be more appropriate if the data was critical, which makes this choice wrong, although it is the second-best answer.Obtain and ensure backups are performed and tested based on requirements set forth by policy is incorrect.

    "correctAnswerText": "Hybrid Cloud",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Hybrid Cloud. \nMultitenancy is a feature of a hybrid cloud model. A hybrid cloud is a combination of two or more cloud infrastructures (private, public, or community) that remain distinct but are interconnected through technology that enables data and application portability, such as cloud bursting for load balancing.  Thomas needs to move his company’s data to a third-party cloud while ensuring multiple users can access it securely. At the same time, he must prevent accidental data leaks by keeping users’ data separate.\nHybrid cloud is the best option because it allows the company to leverage both private and public cloud services. Sensitive data can be stored in a private cloud for security, while other workloads can operate in the public cloud for flexibility. It supports multitenancy with proper data segmentation, ensuring that different users can access only what they are authorized to see.\nMultitenancy means multiple users (or tenants) share the same cloud infrastructure. In a public cloud, this occurs on a large scale, with multiple companies using the same physical infrastructure managed by a third-party provider. In a hybrid cloud, when utilizing the public cloud component, the same multitenancy model applies.\nThe key difference is that hybrid cloud provides additional control over data segmentation and workload placement. The private cloud component allows sensitive data to remain isolated, while the public cloud enables scalable operations.\nPrivate Cloud is incorrect. Private cloud is incorrect. Private cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units). It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.  This also involves a high risk of data exposure due to shared infrastructure.\nCommunity Cloud is incorrect. Community Cloud - provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises.\nPublic Cloud is incorrect. Public Cloud is incorrect. This is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider.  Private cloud provides security but lacks the flexibility needed for third-party cloud migration.",

Physical Destruction is a secure method of ensuring data cannot be recovered, but it is impractical in a cloud environment where physical access to the underlying hardware is not always possible.  \nOverwriting is incorrect. Overwriting is a common data sanitization method where existing data is overwritten with random data. While effective, it may not always be foolproof, especially on SSDs due to wear-leveling algorithms or in cloud environments where you don't control the physical storage. Advanced forensic techniques could potentially recover data if overwriting is not done properly.\nPurging is incorrect. Purging is a method that attempts to make data recovery infeasible, often through methods like degaussing or cryptographic erasure. However, like overwriting, it may not be as reliable in a cloud environment where you don't have direct control over the storage hardware. It might not be as effective as physical destruction in ensuring data is entirely unrecoverable.",

Mandatory vacations are an administrative/detective control that can be used to help determine if an employee is committing egregious activity. For this question, if the activity stops then it is plausible that the senior network administrator is doing something to cause the issue. At that point a more thorough investigation can take place. Discussing ahead of time would be a reactionary approach and if its malicious in nature would not provide a clear answer. Blocking traffic to and from the IP address would cause legitimate activity from that IP to come to a halt. This would also be a reactionary decision and could cause more harm than good.

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Business expectations for organizational implementation. Of the choices, Business expectations for organizational implementation is the best example of a policy. Policies are high level documents that stipulate the requirements necessary for a business or organization to properly and securely achieve their objectives.Statement outlining operational requirements is incorrect. A statement of operation requirement is more of a “how to” statement that would best fit in a procedure.  Procedures can be used to describe everything ranging from user access management to operating system paradigms.Recommendation on appropriate use of business assets is incorrect. A recommendation is a suggestion or proposal as to the best course of action, especially one put forward by an authoritative body.Compulsory methodology for compliance satisfaction is incorrect. A methodology is the formalization of a process or subprocess into phases, stages, and procedures.  While this could be a policy, it is more related to a procedure than a policy, therefore would not be the best choice.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Utilize the Vernam cipher to provide unbreakable encryption. The Vernam cipher is also known as the “one-time pad”. This cipher is theoretically unbreakable if the following conditions are met. 1. The key is longer than the message. 2. The key is 100% randomly generated. 3. The key cannot ever be reused. AES-256 is a symmetric block cipher that is extremely secure and uses 256 keys for its encryption. It is virtually unbreakable, but it is not asymmetric. ECDH is a key exchange that allows two parties, each having an ECC secret key pair, to share over an insecure channel. SHA-256 is a secure hashing algorithm, but it does not help protect confidentiality in the strict sense of the term.Utilize AES-256 to provide strong asymmetric encryption both in transit and at rest is incorrect. Utilize ECDH (Elliptic-curve Diffie–Hellman) to provide a secure method of data encryption both in transit and at rest is incorrect. Utilize SHA-256 for increased protection is incorrect.",

In other words, a procedure dictates the process of how to set up or configure assets. If the procedures are not uniformly developed to address accessibility or access, the risk of misconfiguration is high.Least privilege is not uniform for publicly modifiable data is incorrect. While least privilege is important, the data here is publicly accessible and modifiable, so the risk here is low.Single sign on (SSO) authentication is improperly configured is incorrect. SSO is a mechanism that allows subjects to authenticate themselves only once to a system. With SSO, once subjects are authenticated, they can freely roam the network and access resources and services without being rechallenged for authentication.Fire suppression is inadequate throughout the building is incorrect.

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: In comparison to custom software, COTS is cheaper to procure. COTS is cheaper to procure versus custom or internally developed software. Although initially cheaper, the long-term costs generally swell at a much higher rate and ends up costing more long-term.\nCOTS is inherently more secure than custom software is incorrect. COTS is less secure than custom-made software.\nThe security of COTS is easily managed is incorrect. Because COTS is generally proprietary, it becomes difficult to manage, further because the software is produced for multiple customers the security requirements will differ from the needs of your organization\nCOTS does not require a comprehensive approach for security is incorrect. COTS software is ubiquitous in any organization, so only a comprehensive approach will be effective. Looking at one COTS product out of context has very little meaning. COTS software management must be part of a comprehensive software security risk management. This stands in contrast to the treatment of code developed in-house.

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access by requiring users to provide multiple forms of verification, such as a password and a token or fingerprint. Even if passwords are shared, MFA can prevent unauthorized access.Implementing least privilege is incorrect. Least privilege ensures users have minimal access, but it doesn’t prevent password sharing.Enforcing password complexity is incorrect. While enforcing password complexity improves security, it does not stop users from sharing their passwords.Increasing password expiration frequency is incorrect. Increasing password expiration frequency may encourage better password practices but won’t directly prevent sharing.",

This is not an incident which makes this incorrect.\nContact Cloud provider and discuss viable options to restore operations is incorrect. Contacting the Service provider may be appropriate if this was a consistent issue and service was down for a period longer than what is specified in the contract. We just don’t have enough information here to make this the right answer.\nImplement Disaster Recovery procedures and start moving operations to a hot site is incorrect.

    "correctAnswer": "c",
    "correctAnswerText": "A business continuity plan (BCP)",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: A business continuity Plan (BCP). A Business Continuity Plan (BCP) is a comprehensive document that outlines how an organization will continue to function during and after an emergency, disaster, or other disruptive event. It's designed to ensure that critical business operations can be maintained or quickly resumed, and that people, assets, and overall business processes are protected.\nKey aspects of a BCP include:\n\nScope: It covers a wide range of potential disruptions, from natural disasters to cyber attacks.\nProcedures: It provides detailed, step-by-step procedures for responding to various types of incidents.\nRoles and Responsibilities: It clearly defines who is responsible for what actions during an emergency.\nCommunication Plans: It outlines how to communicate with employees, customers, suppliers, and other stakeholders during a crisis.\nResource Allocation: It identifies the resources needed to maintain essential functions and how to access them.\nRecovery Time Objectives: It sets targets for how quickly different business functions need to be restored.\nTesting and Updating: It includes provisions for regularly testing and updating the plan to ensure it remains effective.\n\nIn the context of Judy's task as a CISSP, creating a BCP aligns well with developing \"a set of procedures that will be used in the event of an adverse incident.\" It's a more specific and actionable document compared to a broader management approach or a more narrowly focused plan like a Disaster Recovery Plan.\nA BCP is an essential component of an organization's risk management strategy, helping to ensure resilience and continuity in the face of various threats and disruptions.\nA business impact assessment (BIA) is incorrect. A BIA is a process that determines and evaluates the potential effects of an interruption to critical business operations as a result of a disaster, accident, or emergency. It helps identify critical business functions and their recovery requirements. While crucial, a BIA is typically a precursor to developing the full set of procedures Judy is creating.\nA risk assessment is incorrect. A risk assessment is the process of identifying, analyzing, and evaluating potential risks to an organization's assets, individuals, or operations. While it's an important step in developing a business continuity plan, it's just one component of the broader task Judy is undertaking.\nA Disaster recovery plan (DRP) is incorrect. A DRP is a documented process or set of procedures designed specifically to recover and protect an organization's IT infrastructure in the event of a disaster. While important, a DRP is more narrowly focused on IT systems and doesn't encompass the full range of procedures Judy is developing for various types of adverse incidents or disasters.",

Data owners are responsible for classification of data and hold legal rights and complete control over the data they create. They are also responsible for identifying when data needs to be disposed.\nHarold is the Data Steward is incorrect.  A data steward is typically responsible for ensuring data quality, governance, and data management policies. They manage data integrity and ensure compliance with data standards, but they do not hold legal ownership or the authority to classify data as a data owner does. Since Harold misclassified data, he aligns more with the role of a data owner, not a steward.\nHarold is the Data Custodian is incorrect.  Data custodians are responsible for the day-to-day maintenance and protection of the data but do not have the authority to classify or make decisions regarding its use. Their role includes implementing security controls, ensuring backups, and safeguarding data. Harold’s role in this scenario involved data classification, which is beyond the scope of a data custodian's responsibilities.\nHarold is the Data Processor is incorrect.  A data processor handles data on behalf of the data owner, often as a third party. They do not have authority over the classification or ownership of data; they simply process it following instructions provided by the data owner. Since Harold's actions were related to classifying the data, this option does not fit his role in this scenario.",

An assessor would assess (as would an auditor), and an appraisal is a review, and does not necessarily have to deal with money.Review Standards in relation to implemented firewall controls. is incorrect. While reviewing standards is a good choice, limiting just to firewalls is incorrect.Modify and implement new policies to comply with standards. is incorrect.

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Bastion Host. A bastion host is a specialized system that is deliberately exposed on a public network. From a secured network perspective, it is the only node exposed to the outside world and is therefore very prone to attacks. A bastion host is hardened which makes it capable of withstanding such attacks. Therefore, this is the best answer.Firewall is incorrect. A firewall would detect and block attacks on an internal network.  Because the services and assets being attacked are located externally, this would be an ineffective control.  There are cases (primarily in larger organizations) where a bastion sits behind a border firewall.  The question specifically mentions that Tooka is small and budget conscious, which would allow you to infer that they do not have multiple firewalls.Screened subnet is incorrect. A screened subnet can also be called a DMZ.  A DMZ is a physical or logical subnet that separates a local area network (LAN) from other untrusted networks.  While this does help protect an organization's assets, a DMZ without a bastion host would not be sufficient.NIDS (Network Intrusion Detection System) is incorrect. A NIDS would monitor instructions from the outside to the internal network. NIDS allow the inspection of audit logs and real-time system events. Intrusion inspection is generally used to detect intrusion attempts, but they can also be employed to detect system failures or rate overall performance.  Luke has already detected the attack which makes this answer incorrect.",

Single sign-on (SSO) authentication is improperly configured is the greatest concern when it comes to the misrepresentation of facts. Improperly configured SSO can lead to significant security risks, including unauthorized access to multiple systems and services. If SSO is compromised, it could allow attackers to gain access to sensitive data or systems without the proper credentials, leading to the potential for fraud, data breaches, and the misrepresentation of facts (data integrity). SSO is often used to streamline access across different systems, so any weaknesses in its configuration can have widespread, serious consequences.Least privilege is not uniform for publicly modifiable data is incorrect. Least privilege is not uniform for publicly modifiable data: While the principle of least privilege is important, publicly modifiable data typically involves less sensitive information. The misconfiguration here could lead to unintended modifications but is generally less concerning than a compromised authentication system.Dual control is not uniformly applied is incorrect. Dual control is the process of using two or more separate entities (usually persons) at the same time to help layer security controls for sensitive information or functions.  No single person is permitted to access or use the materials without the other.Lack of uniform procedures related to accessibility is incorrect. Procedures are the “how” of documentation.  In other words, a procedure dictates the process of how to set up or configure assets.

In Full RBAC, the roles are defined by the organization’s policy and access control infrastructure, and then applied to applications and systems across the enterprise.Non-RBAC is incorrect. Non-RBAC grants user access to data or an application using ACLs. There are no formal “roles” associated with mappings, other than any identified by the particular user.Limited RBAC is incorrect. Limited RBAC - users are mapped to roles within a single application rather than through an organization-wide role structure.Hybrid RBAC is incorrect. Hybrid RBAC - applies a role to multiple applications or systems based on a user’s specific role within the organization. There are also instances where the user may be assigned to roles defined solely within specific applications.",

The question was particularly tricky as it didn’t directly say firewall. Rule based access controls are applied to Next Generation Firewalls based on categories which would have the ability to block content such as an adult website. These controls apply rules to filter out unwanted content based on predefined criteria or categories, making it the most likely explanation for why access to adult sites is blocked.A layer 5 firewall is in place stopping users from accessing not safe for work content is incorrect. While firewalls operate at various layers of the OSI model, a Layer 5 (Session Layer) firewall is not a standard term. Instead, firewalls that filter content typically operate at Layer 7 (Application Layer). The Layer 5 reference is misleading in this context, as it does not align with how content filtering and access controls are generally implemented.Acceptable use policies are in place is incorrect. While acceptable use policies (AUPs) define the rules for acceptable behavior and use of company resources, they do not actively block or filter content. Policies are guidelines and are enforced through technical controls like firewalls or web filters.An IPS (Intrusion prevention system) is installed and protecting outside malicious traffic from entering the network. is incorrect. An IPS is designed to detect and prevent malicious activities or attacks. It does not typically handle content filtering based on categories like adult sites. An IPS focuses on security threats and attacks, rather than content control.",

Without their support, you cannot realistically or effectively follow through or create the plan.\nIdentify critical functions of the organization to properly asses business need is incorrect.  While identifying critical functions is indeed important, this step falls under the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) phase. The BIA focuses on determining the organization's most important operations and services that, if disrupted, could severely impact the business. However, before this analysis can be conducted, senior management must give their approval for the BC/DR planning process. Without management's backing, the project might lack sufficient resources and priority. Therefore, identifying critical functions is not the first step; it comes after management's approval and initial support are secured.\nIdentify critical resources needed to implement strategy is incorrect.  Identifying critical resources, such as personnel, technology, equipment, and infrastructure, is vital to executing the BC/DR plan. However, this step occurs later in the planning process. Before resources can be allocated or identified, the organization needs to ensure that leadership is committed to the BC/DR plan, and that proper governance structures are in place. Management approval provides the authorization to use company resources and funds for the BC/DR effort. This means that identifying resources cannot happen until after management approval and the initial stages of the plan are completed.\nIdentify business processes is incorrect.  This step is typically part of the Business Impact Analysis (BIA) and helps the organization understand which business processes are essential to maintain during a disaster or disruption. By identifying key business processes, the organization can prioritize its recovery efforts based on which processes are most critical to continuing operations. However, like identifying critical functions, this step happens after management has approved the creation of the BC/DR plan. Without management support, there may not be the authority to assess and prioritize business processes across the organization.",

With SSO, once subjects are authenticated, they can freely roam the network and access resources and services without being rechallenged for authentication.Least privilege is not uniform for publicly modifiable data is incorrect. While least privilege is important, the data here is publicly accessible and modifiable, so the risk here is low.Fire suppression is inadequate throughout the building is incorrect. While human life is the most important consideration we should make, this answer does not answer the question.Lack of uniform procedures related to accessibility is incorrect. Procedures are the “how” of documentation.  In other words, a procedure dictates the process of how to set up or configure assets.  If the procedures are not uniformly developed to address accessibility or access, the risk of misconfiguration is high.",

Privacy by Design is a framework based on proactively embedding privacy into the design and operation of IT systems, networked infrastructure, and business practices, with the goal of establishing the strongest protection of privacy. There are seven foundational principles.\ni. Proactive not reactive (preventative not remedial) - Anticipate, identify, and prevent invasive events before they happen; this means taking action before the fact, not afterward.\n ii. Privacy as the default setting - Ensure personal data is automatically protected in all IT systems or business practices, with no added action required by any individual.\n iii. Embed privacy into design - Privacy measures should not be add-ons, but fully integrated components of the system.\n iv. Retain full functionality (positive-sum, not zero-sum) - Privacy by Design employs a “win-win” approach to all legitimate system design goals; that is, both privacy and security are important, and no unnecessary trade-offs need to be made to achieve both.\n v. Ensure end-to-end security - Data lifecycle security means all data should be securely retained as needed and destroyed when no longer needed.\n vi. Maintain visibility and transparency - Assure stakeholders that business practices and technologies are operating according to objectives and subject to independent verification.\n vii. Respect user privacy - Keep things user-centric; individual privacy interests must be supported by strong privacy defaults, appropriate notice, and user-friendly options.\n \nZero Trust is incorrect. Zero Trust is a set of cybersecurity paradigms that move defenses from static, network- based perimeters to focus on users, assets, and resources. Zero trust assumes there is no implicit trust granted to assets or user accounts based solely on their physical or network location (i.e., local area networks versus the internet) or based on asset ownership (enterprise or personally owned). Authentication and authorization (both subject and device) are discrete functions performed before a session to an enterprise resource is established. Zero trust focus on protecting resources (assets, services, workflows, network accounts, etc.), not network segments, as the network location is no longer seen as the prime component to the security posture of the resource.\nState Machine Model is incorrect. The State Machine Model describes the behavior of a system as it moves between one state and another. The purpose is to define which actions will be permitted at any point in time to ensure that a secure state (a point in time when things are secure) is preserved.\nConfinement is incorrect. Confinement (sandboxing) is the ability to control read / write activity as software executes in a system and accesses memory.",

Ultimately, an organization’s risk appetite will help them determine what path they want to take in relation to implementing countermeasures (or not implement).A robust patch management program is incorrect. A patch management program would help control vulnerabilities but would not address threats or risk.  Therefore, this is an incomplete solution.Funding related to countermeasures is incorrect. Funding is an important aspect of any organization's security program.  However, the cost of controls is just one aspect that one must consider.  That consideration is based upon the risk appetite of the organization.Risk assessment is incorrect. A risk assessment will help an organization determine what the risks of an organization are, and assist in researching possible solutions.  The risk assessment will provide the necessary information needed to help an organization determine what controls to utilize, but their decision is based upon appetite, not the risk assessment.",

This formula can be used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a safeguard or to compare various safeguards to determine which are most effective. Justin has already implemented controls, so the remaining risk is residual.\nTransferred risk is incorrect. Transferred risk is requiring others to handle the risks and the associated costs of managing that risk. Generally, we think of this as a type of insurance.\nInherent risk is incorrect. Inherent risk is the amount of risk that exists in the absence of controls. In other words, before an organization implements countermeasures, the risk that exists is referred to as inherent risk.\nAvoided risk is incorrect.  Risk avoidance is the process of systematically avoiding risk by eliminating the activities or conditions that introduce it. For example, if a remote access tool is deemed too insecure, the organization might decide not to deploy it at all. By doing so, the associated risk is avoided entirely, rather than merely reduced.",

Implementing security checkpoints and conducting code reviews ensures that security is integrated throughout the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This process helps the company catch vulnerabilities early, ensuring that any security risks are identified and mitigated before the software is deployed. Security checkpoints enforce standards at various phases of development, while code reviews allow for the detection of security flaws that automated tools might miss. This proactive approach supports regulatory compliance by ensuring that security practices are consistently applied and verifiable.Encrypt data in production environments is incorrect. While encrypting data in production environments is a critical security measure, it focuses on securing data at rest or in transit during use, not on the development process itself. It does not address security vulnerabilities that may exist in the software’s code or structure.Allow developers to push updates without security sign-off is incorrect. Allowing developers to push updates without security sign-off introduces significant risks. Security sign-offs ensure that new code has been properly tested for vulnerabilities. Skipping this step could allow untested or insecure code into production, increasing the likelihood of introducing vulnerabilities or regulatory violations.Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for development systems is incorrect. Although multi-factor authentication (MFA) enhances the security of systems by protecting access to development environments, it does not directly improve the security of the code or the development lifecycle. MFA helps secure developer accounts, but it does not address the need for security testing or code reviews to find and fix vulnerabilities before deployment.",

By requiring two different factors, 2FA enhances the security of sensitive data and resources, preventing unauthorized access and maintaining confidentiality.\nNon-repudiation is incorrect.  Non-repudiation ensures that an action or transaction cannot be denied by the user who performed it. While 2FA strengthens authentication and verifies a user's identity, it does not directly ensure non-repudiation, as that typically requires mechanisms like digital signatures or audit trails.\nAvailability is incorrect.   2FA does not directly address system availability. While it may indirectly contribute by protecting systems from unauthorized access that could lead to downtime, its primary focus is not on ensuring that systems remain operational or accessible.\nIntegrity is incorrect.  While 2FA can help prevent unauthorized changes to data (which supports data integrity), its primary focus is not on ensuring the accuracy or consistency of information but rather on preventing unauthorized access.",

Data Creation - The first phase of the data lifecycle is the creation/capture of data. Data is typically\ncreated by an organization in one of 3 ways:\nA. Data Acquisition: acquiring already existing data which has been produced outside the\norganization.\nB. Data Entry: manual entry of new data by personnel within the organization\nC. Data Capture: capture of data generated by devices used in various processes in the organization.\n2. Storage - Once data has been created within the organization, it needs to be stored and protected, with the appropriate level of security applied, which includes classifying it for easy retrieval and determining access controls. For example, files can be marked as “internal” or “external,” which then decides how tight of a lid it needs to be kept under.\n3. Usage - Data is used to support activities in the organization. Data can be viewed, processed, modified and saved.\n4. Archival - The copying of data to an environment where it is stored in case it is needed again in an active production environment, and the removal of this data from all active production environments.  A data archive is simply a place where data is stored, but where no maintenance or general usage occurs. If necessary, the data can be restored to an environment where it can be used.\n5. Destruction - Data destruction or purging is the removal of every copy of a data item from an organization. It is typically done from an archive storage location.\nSource:  Adam Gordon – Author of ISC2 CBK v4.\nCreation is incorrect.\nUsage is incorrect.\nArchival is incorrect.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Implementation of dual control access to confidential information. Dual control is the process of using two or more separate entities (usually persons) at the same time to help layer security controls for sensitive information or functions. No single person is permitted to access or use the materials without the other.Implementation of SOD (Separation of duties) is incorrect. SOD refers to the practice of dividing critical tasks among multiple individuals to prevent fraud, errors, or abuse of power. For example, one person may be responsible for initiating a financial transaction, while another approves it. While this helps with control over tasks, it doesn’t necessarily involve simultaneous action to access confidential information. SOD is about dividing responsibilities, but it doesn’t require people to act together at the same time, making it less fitting for the scenario.Utilization of M of N control for confidential areas is incorrect. M of N control is a cryptographic technique where a minimum number of individuals (\"M\") out of a total number (\"N\") are required to perform a function, such as decrypting sensitive information. For example, 3 out of 5 data custodians might be needed to unlock certain data. While this does involve multiple parties, it typically applies to cryptographic systems or data recovery processes, not necessarily the type of simultaneous action Courtney implemented for controlling access to confidential areas.Utilization of split knowledge for users looking to access confidential information is incorrect. Split knowledge is a security control where no individual has complete knowledge of a sensitive process or piece of information. This is often used in cryptographic systems, where parts of a cryptographic key are divided among individuals. Like M of N control, split knowledge focuses on ensuring no single person can independently compromise security, but it does not directly require simultaneous actions to access confidential information. It’s not as aligned with the scenario where two or more people need to act together at the same time.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Security Policies. Security Policies are critical in guiding employees on how to recognize and respond to security threats, such as malicious emails. If the data breach occurred due to a lack of security management, it is most likely that the organization had inadequate or poorly enforced security policies. These policies typically include guidelines for email security, phishing awareness, and incident response, which help prevent such breaches.Cybersecurity Framework is incorrect. While a cybersecurity framework provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risk, the immediate issue in this scenario is more likely related to the lack of specific security policies that directly address employee behavior and awareness.Strategic Plan is incorrect. The strategic plan would be created as part of security governance and enforced by the security management.  A strategic plan outlines long-term goals and objectives, including those related to security, but it is not directly responsible for the day-to-day management and enforcement of security practices that would prevent incidents like phishing attacks.Enterprise Architecture is incorrect. The enterprise architecture is created and determined as part of security governance, not security management.  Enterprise architecture involves the overall structure and operation of an organization's IT infrastructure. While important, it is less directly connected to the specific issue of employee awareness and behavior that led to the data breach.",

    "correctAnswerText": "CBAC (Context-Based Access Control)",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: CBAC (Context-Based Access Control). CBAC is specifically designed to evaluate access requests based on contextual factors that may vary depending on the situation. Unlike ABAC, which relies on attributes of users and resources, CBAC considers the current context in which access is requested, such as the user's location, time of access, and the security status of the device. This makes CBAC particularly suitable for scenarios where security posture is influenced by dynamic factors, enabling organizations to implement more granular and responsive access control measures.\nJIT (Just-In-Time) is incorrect. Using the just-in-time (JIT) access methodology, organizations can provide elevated and granular privileged access to an application or system in order to perform a necessary task. This granular approach mitigates the risk of privileged account abuse by significantly reducing the amount of time a bad actor or malicious insider has to gain access to privileged accounts before moving laterally through a system and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. Temporary elevation allows the temporary elevation of privileges, enabling users to access privileged accounts or run privileged commands on a by-request, timed basis. Access is removed when time is up.\nABAC (Attribute based access control) is incorrect. ABAC evaluates access based on a wide range of attributes associated with users, resources, and the environment. While it considers some contextual factors, its primary focus is on static attributes rather than the dynamic context in which access is requested. This can make ABAC less responsive to real-time changes in conditions that affect security, making CBAC a more appropriate choice for Michael’s needs.\nHybrid-RBAC is incorrect. Hybrid-RBAC combines elements of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with other models, primarily relying on predefined roles to grant access. While it allows for some flexibility, it does not adequately address the need for evaluating dynamic contextual conditions, which is essential for understanding the security posture during access requests. CBAC offers a more granular approach by incorporating real-time context into access decisions.",

    "correctAnswerText": "Embedding security requirements early",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Embedding security requirements early. When adopting DevSecOps, the primary focus should be embedding security requirements early in the software development lifecycle (SDLC). This approach ensures that security is built into the foundation of the application from the very beginning rather than being an afterthought. By considering security during the requirements and design phases, developers can avoid costly vulnerabilities and rework, making the application inherently more secure.Automating code reviews is incorrect. Automating code reviews is a critical component of DevSecOps as it helps continuously assess the code for security vulnerabilities. However, automating code reviews comes after security requirements are defined and embedded in the design phase. If security is not integrated from the beginning, code reviews may miss fundamental architectural flaws or risks that could have been avoided with early security planning.Continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines is incorrect. CI/CD pipelines are crucial to the DevOps process, ensuring that code is built, tested, and deployed quickly and efficiently. However, security should be an integral part of the CI/CD pipeline, meaning it needs to be incorporated early in the process, not after the pipeline is already set up. Security checks, such as static analysis and vulnerability scanning, can be added to CI/CD, but this happens once security requirements have been established.Penetration testing of applications is incorrect. Penetration testing is a valuable tool for identifying vulnerabilities, but it typically happens later in the development lifecycle—after the application is functional or even deployed. Penetration testing is an external validation of security measures, but by the time it is performed, there might already be deep-rooted security flaws in the application. Thus, focusing on embedding security requirements early is more effective and ensures that security is considered at every stage of development, not just at the end.",

While CI/CD practices can include security testing, they are more effective when security considerations have already been embedded in the design.Establish regular security audits during development is incorrect. While establishing regular security audits is beneficial for identifying vulnerabilities and ensuring that security controls are in place, these audits are most effective when they are integrated into the entire development process, beginning with the design phase.

Sandboxes are often used to isolate the code while testing. Synthetic Transactions are also often used to verify system performance by executing a script that will produce known, or expected results. DAST is also sometimes referred to as “black box testing” or “play testing.” DAST should be performed in a test environment that mimics the production environment but that is completely isolated from it. While DAST is an important method of software assessment (particularly in discovering potential interoperability problems with other production systems/software), it may not uncover flaws in the underlying code if the test team does not trigger those actions that reveal problems.\nFuzz testing is incorrect. Fuzz Testing is a specialized form of dynamic testing that uses randomized inputs to stress a system looking for unexpected outcomes. There are two types:\n1. Mutation (dumb) - uses input values from actual operations of the system/software and mutates them.\n2. Generational (intelligent) - develops data models and inputs based on an understanding of the types of data a program or system would use.",

Here is how it works: An adversary forges the TGS ticket using the service account password hash. No intermediary TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket) is needed. That means Silver Ticket attacks can be created without any communication with a Domain Controller, making them easier to generate and harder for targeted organizations to detect.

Stateful NAT is the use of a mapping database that maps the internal client request and the WAN service being requested. When the request is received by the NAT server, it changes the internal IP of the client to the Public IP of the NAT server and then sends the request out to the WAN. Once a reply is received, the NAT server looks up the source address of the reply in the database and delivers the data to the internal client that made the request.\nThere are two modes of operation:\n                i. Static NAT - internal client is assigned a permanent mapping to a specific public IP address\n                ii. Dynamic NAT - rotates the internal clients among several public IP addresses to facilitate multiple clients communicating through the NAT server\nAutomatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA) is incorrect. APIPA assigns an IP address in the 169.254. range to a system if DHCP stops working.\nPAT is incorrect. PAT is an extension to NAT that permits multiple devices on a local area network (LAN) to be mapped to a single public IP address, with the intent of conserving IP addresses.\nCircuit Switching is incorrect. Circuit Switching was originally designed to handle the analog phone system traffic management (POTS). Not really used any longer for data networks. Employs a set of permanent, physical connections (circuits) to reliably connect and transmit data. Used in transportation systems, power distribution systems and irrigation systems.",

There is no criteria regarding minimum or maximum distance of an alternate site as every disaster could potentially have different results.\nThe alternative site should be based upon the company’s risk tolerance is incorrect. Risk tolerance is the capability of an organization to handle any subsequent losses that are associated with any risks. It would be difficult and impractical to base an alternative site off of this as risk tolerance can be fluid and change at a moment’s notice. It would get very expensive very quickly if an organization was moving alternate sites based off of this.\nThe alternative site should be based off the calculated risk and the likelihood of the event is incorrect. It would be difficult to determine the likelihood of an event accurately enough to base it on where the alternative site will be located.

AES-CBC provides confidentiality.  AES first encrypts the source data and sends to the NAND for storage.  CBC (Cipher Block Chaining) mode provides a scheme for encryption or decryption by using an initialization vector – IV. The IV has the same size as the block that is encrypted. In general, the IV usually is a random number, not a nonce.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: JIT (Just-In-Time). Using the just-in-time (JIT) access methodology, organizations can provide elevated and granular privileged access to an application or system in order to perform a necessary task. This granular approach mitigates the risk of privileged account abuse by significantly reducing the amount of time a bad actor or malicious insider has to gain access to privileged accounts before moving laterally through a system and gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data. Temporary elevation allows the temporary elevation of privileges, enabling users to access privileged accounts or run privileged commands on a by-request, timed basis. Access is removed when time is up.ABAC (Attribute based access control) is incorrect. RBA (Risk Based Access Control) is incorrect. RBA is a form of strong authentication that calculates a risk score for any given access attempt in real time, based on a predefined set of rules. Users are then presented with authentication options appropriate to that risk level.Hybrid-RBAC is incorrect. Hybrid RBAC applies a role to multiple applications or systems based on a user’s specific role within the organization. There are also instances where the user may be assigned to roles defined solely within specific applications.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: SAST (static testing). SAST evaluates software without running it. It performs an analysis of source code or compiled application. SAST utilized a white box approach and can also help determine performance issues (bugs in the code that hinder successful execution of the software), SAST is an important way to find security problems before the software is put into production. SAST does not remediate issues, just locates them.\nDAST (dynamic testing) is incorrect. DAST evaluates software in a runtime environment by executing the software to see what it does. Sandboxes are often used to isolate the code while testing. Synthetic Transactions are also often used to verify system performance by executing a script that will produce known, or expected results. DAST is also sometimes referred to as “black box testing” or “play testing.” DAST should be performed in a test environment that mimics the production environment but that is completely isolated from it. While DAST is an important method of software assessment (particularly in discovering potential interoperability problems with other production systems/software), it may not uncover flaws in the underlying code if the test team does not trigger those actions that reveal problems.\nFuzz testing is incorrect. Fuzz Testing is a specialized form of dynamic testing that uses randomized inputs to stress a system looking for unexpected outcomes. There are two types:\n1. Mutation (dumb) - uses input values from actual operations of the system/software and mutates them.\n2. Generational (intelligent) - develops data models and inputs based on an understanding of the types of data a program or system would use.\nInterface testing is incorrect. Interface Testing assesses performance of modules against the interface specification(s) to ensure proper operations. There are three types:\n1. Application Programming Interface (API)\n2. User Interface (UI)\n3. Physical Interface",

The question is describing a Cross-site scripting vulnerability (XSS), and there are three types; reflected, stored, and DOM-based. Escaping involves adding a special character before the string so it is interpreted correctly, which would prevent untrusted characters from being used to leverage vulnerabilities.Use of safe API’s and parameterized queries is incorrect. While using safe APIs and parameterized queries is an excellent countermeasure against SQL injection attacks, it doesn't directly address the issue of untrusted data being inserted into a webpage. SQL injection concerns the manipulation of database queries, whereas the question focuses on protecting webpage content from untrusted inputs.Restrict access to directories is incorrect. Restricting directory access is a security measure that can help prevent unauthorized access to sensitive files and directories, but it doesn’t address the core issue of untrusted data being inserted into the webpage. This measure would be more useful in scenarios involving directory traversal or unauthorized file access rather than data manipulation on a webpage.Employ hardening procedures is incorrect. Hardening procedures involve strengthening the overall security of systems, applications, or networks (e.g., by disabling unused services, applying patches, or enforcing strong password policies). While important, hardening is too general for this specific issue. It does not directly mitigate the risk of untrusted data affecting the webpage.",

Separation of duties would act as a preventative measure to ensure that users/employees cannot complete a process without further checks from others. A good example would be: The person signing the check at work is not also the person with access to the funds. It helps ensure proper measures are taken to prevent fraud, but can encourage collusion due to the extra requirement needed to perform certain tasks.\nPolicies are in place prevent production database modifications from taking place is incorrect. Polices should not be considered a preventative control. While mandatory, they still have to be enforced so on their own they would not stop someone from modifying the production database.\nAbstraction of the production environment is in place is incorrect. Abstraction is a method to hide unnecessary details from users. This method would not restrict Franklin from entering code into the production environment.\nDatabase views are in place to prevent unauthorized editing is incorrect. The use of a database view allows sensitive information to be hidden from unauthorized users by creating a filtered or restricted perspective of the database. While this could be an effective access control mechanism to prevent unauthorized reading or editing of data, it does not specifically address or prevent Franklin from entering new code into the production environment. Database views are primarily used to restrict data exposure rather than enforce operational controls such as separation of duties.",

RAID 5 is the best option because it provides a good balance of redundancy, improved read speed, and cost-effectiveness, making it the most suitable choice for your requirements.Raid 6 is incorrect. RAID 6 is similar to RAID 5 but with an additional layer of parity, allowing it to withstand the failure of two drives instead of one. While this offers higher redundancy, it comes at a higher cost because it requires more drives (at least four) and has slightly slower write performance due to the additional parity calculations. It’s more expensive and may be overkill if budget is a concern.Raid 1 is incorrect. RAID 1 mirrors data across two drives, offering high redundancy by maintaining an exact copy of all data on each drive. While it provides good redundancy and read speed (since data can be read from either drive), it’s not the most cost-effective solution because it requires double the storage capacity. You only get half the usable storage space, which can be expensive.Raid 10 is incorrect. RAID 10 combines the features of RAID 1 (mirroring) and RAID 0 (striping), providing both redundancy and high performance. However, it’s the most expensive option because it requires at least four drives, and like RAID 1, you only get half the usable storage space. While RAID 10 offers the best performance and redundancy, it is not the most affordable solution.",

A Covert channel is where one process signals information to another process by modulating its own use of system resources (e.g., central processing unit time) in such a way that this manipulation affects the real response time observed by the second process.  Source:  https://doi.org/10.6028/NIST.SP.800-53r4.  A covert channel is unlikely as there is no indication that this is taking place based on the information provided.",

Situational awareness is being aware of what is happening around you in terms of where you are, where you are supposed to be, and whether anyone or anything around you is a threat to your health and safety. When there is a disaster, it is important to ensure protection of human life at all costs. Not having situational awareness could create potentially catastrophic issues if execution of disaster recovery is not performed correctly or poorly as a result of confusion or lack of awareness.Lack of an acceptable Recovery point objective (RPO) is incorrect. RPO is the amount of data, as a measure of time, we are willing to lose during a recovery event.  So, for example: if the RPO is one hour, an organization is willing and able to lose one hour of data without any major disruption to the business.Lack of an acceptable Recovery time objective (RTO) is incorrect. RTO is the EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME that we can restore/recover an asset to full functionality if everything goes as planned, and nothing else goes wrong.Shortened Maximum Tolerable Downtime (MTD) is incorrect.

    "correctAnswerText": "Implement controls based on employees’ responsibilities within the organization",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Implement controls based on employees’ responsibilities within the organization. This is describing Role based access controls which restricts (or allows) access based on a person's role within an organization.  RBAC is a non-discretionary access control model where system access is determined by the individual’s role within the organization. This approach ensures that employees are only granted the permissions necessary to perform their job functions, following the principle of least privilege. In large organizations such as Susanne’s 3,000-employee firm, RBAC provides scalability and consistency in managing access rights across multiple systems.\nImplement a labeling access control system is incorrect. This is the description of Mandatory access controls. This uses labels to grant or deny access.  MAC is typically used in environments requiring highly restrictive access control policies, such as government or military systems, and does not align with the business-driven needs of an accounting firm.\nImplement DAC (discretionary access controls) determined by the data owner is incorrect. Discretionary Access Control (DAC) allows each user to control access to their own data and is the opposite of non-discretionary access controls.  DAC is generally considered less secure because it can lead to excessive permissions and unauthorized data sharing.\nImplement controls based upon specific characteristics is incorrect. This describes Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), which is a non-discretionary access model. Unlike RBAC, where access is granted based on predefined roles, ABAC determines access dynamically based on a combination of user attributes, resource attributes, environmental conditions, and security policies.  ABAC enforces centralized policies to ensure fine-grained access control. However, while ABAC is non-discretionary, it is not the best fit for this scenario because the question describes access control based on employees' job responsibilities, which aligns more with RBAC rather than attribute-driven access decisions.",

Reviewing test data would not provide the correct information needed for Kimberly to make an informed decision. Test data is generally not utilized in a real production environment (there are exceptions), so any decisions made off this in relation to the security program may be incomplete.\nObtain funding for proper implementation for the program is incorrect.

    "correctAnswerText": "Deploy Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Deploy Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools.  Data Loss Prevention (DLP) tools are specifically designed to monitor, detect, and prevent unauthorized transmission of sensitive information. In this scenario, where sensitive customer data is being transmitted to an external IP address, a DLP solution would provide real-time protection by identifying and blocking suspicious data transfers. DLP tools can enforce policies to restrict or stop data exfiltration based on predefined rules, such as detecting sensitive information like customer data, credit card details, or personally identifiable information (PII). This makes DLP the most appropriate control to immediately mitigate and prevent further data leakage.\nUpdate the firewall rules to block outbound traffic is incorrect. While updating firewall rules to block outbound traffic to the suspicious IP address might stop the specific ongoing data leak, it is not a comprehensive or proactive solution. Firewalls are designed to control traffic flow based on network policies, not to detect or analyze the content of data leaving the network. In this case, blocking traffic to a single IP address would not prevent similar exfiltration attempts targeting different external IP addresses. Without deeper inspection capabilities, such as those provided by DLP, the organization would still be vulnerable to data leakage.\nPerform a network segmentation audit is incorrect. A network segmentation audit focuses on reviewing and optimizing how the network is segmented to limit access to critical systems. While this is an important long-term measure to strengthen security, it would not address the immediate problem of outbound data leakage. An audit might reveal weaknesses in the network's design that allowed the unauthorized traffic, but it would not stop the current leak or detect unauthorized data transfers in real-time.\nEnforce strict password policies for the server is incorrect. Stricter password policies are critical for securing access to the server and reducing the likelihood of unauthorized access. However, they do not address the issue of data leakage through outbound traffic. Even with robust authentication measures in place, sensitive data could still be exfiltrated if an attacker gains access to the server by other means or exploits vulnerabilities in applications running on the server. Therefore, while important, stricter password policies are not a direct solution to this specific problem.",

Type 1 – something you know, ex: a password, type 2 – something you have, ex: security token, and Type 3, Someone you are, Biometrics, ex: fingerprint or facial recognition. To ensure more robust security, implementing two factors would help increase security. In this question, the user would need to know a password (type 1) and utilize facial recognition (type 3) to access to health recordsEnable MFA (multi-factor authentication) requiring type 3 biometric authentication in conjunction with the facial recognition is incorrect. While MFA is recommended, having two methods utilizing biometrics would not fulfill the MFA requirement as both are Type 3.Implement the need to know of patient records as per HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations is incorrect. Need to know would not help prevent further incidents as the authentication was improperly authorized.Encrypt all data classified as PHI (private health information) with AES (advanced encryption standard) to prevent unauthorized access is incorrect. AES encryption would not prevent an unauthorized user from logging into the health records and viewing the data.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Avoid the reading of files dynamically based on user input.. The question is describing a Directory/Path Transversal. Typically, Path Traversal attacks are used to gain access to sensitive information stored within arbitrary files in other areas of a web application. Since files containing sensitive information may contain confidential information such as passwords, a successful Path Traversal attack may allow an attacker to take their reconnaissance further or exploit other application security vulnerabilities. The best way to eliminate Path Traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid reading files dynamically based on user input. If this is not possible, the application should employ strong input validation by maintaining a whitelist of files that can be included in order to limit the attacker’s control over what gets included.

    "correctAnswerText": "Security Logs",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Security Logs. Security logs are specifically designed to capture and track events related to potential security issues, such as unauthorized access attempts, firewall activity, and intrusion detection alerts. These logs provide insights into suspicious behaviors and attacks, making them the most effective tool for detecting attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in a network environment. Security logs are critical in identifying patterns of attacks, unusual access behavior, or security policy violations, and they form a vital part of an organization’s defense mechanisms against cyber threats.System Logs is incorrect. System logs typically record information about the performance and operational status of hardware and operating systems. While system logs can provide valuable insights into errors or system failures, they do not focus specifically on security-related events. They are more useful for diagnosing performance issues or hardware failures than for detecting security incidents or attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.Application Logs is incorrect. Application logs track events within specific applications, such as errors or usage statistics, and while they are helpful in monitoring application performance, they are not designed to capture broader network-based threats. Application logs would miss activities such as unauthorized network access or exploit attempts that occur outside of the specific application being logged. These logs are primarily focused on internal application issues, not overall network security.Network Logs is incorrect. Network logs track the flow of data across the network, providing information about network traffic patterns, bandwidth usage, and connectivity issues. While network logs can be helpful for understanding traffic trends and diagnosing network performance problems, they may not include detailed security information. Network logs focus on the operational aspects of traffic rather than specific security events, and without correlation to security logs, they might miss or fail to adequately report on suspicious activities or attacks targeting vulnerabilities.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Implement TLS for data in transit. Sensitive data exposure is where malicious individuals can modify or obtain sensitive data if the application does not handle sensitive data securely. This is an OWASP top 10 vulnerability. If data is exposed it can be easily intercepted and decoded if a weak encryption algorithm is being used. The attacker can also launch SQL attacks by gaining this additional information.Use of safe API’s (Application Programming Interface) and parameterized queries is incorrect. Use of safe API’s and parameterized queries would be a countermeasure for SQL injection.  While SQL is mentioned in the question, the vulnerability being described is sensitive data exposure.Implement the principle of least privilege is incorrect. Least privilege is an access control method which is used as a preventative control to ensure users only have access to what they need to perform their duties.  It would not be a detective control.Avoid the reading of files dynamically based on user input. is incorrect. This is the countermeasure for a Directory path traversal.  Typically, Path Traversal attacks are used to gain access to sensitive information stored within arbitrary files in other areas of a web application. Since files containing sensitive information may contain confidential information such as passwords, a successful Path Traversal attack may allow an attacker to take their reconnaissance further or exploit other application security vulnerabilities.  The best way to eliminate Path Traversal vulnerabilities is to avoid reading files dynamically based on user input. If this is not possible, the application should employ strong input validation by maintaining a whitelist of files that can be included in order to limit the attacker’s control over what gets included.

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: A solid state drive (SSD) has been overwritten and transferred to a third party for incineration. Due to the SSD being transferred outside the organization, there is new risk introduced by the way of a third-party involvement. There is no verification being done to provide assurance that the data drives were indeed properly destroyed.A physical hard disk drive (HDD) has been overwritten and redeployed interdepartmentally is incorrect. While there is no verification being done to ensure the HDD has been overwritten, because it is moving within the organization the risk is lower than if it were to be provided to a third party.A physical hard disk drive (HDD) has been degaussed, verified, and released to a third party for shredding is incorrect. The drive has been both overwritten and degaussed which destroys its polarity, making it difficult to recover data.  Furthermore, the sanitization has been verified before sending to a third-party shredding.  This answer is the most secure of the options.A flash drive has been overwritten, verified, and redeployed interdepartmentally is incorrect. The flash drive has been overwritten with verification.  While some remanence can remain with a flash drive, because it is moving within the organization, this is low risk.",

This proactive approach allows organizations to catch issues such as outdated software, misconfigurations, or unpatched vulnerabilities early on. By integrating scanning into the development lifecycle, the risk of deploying vulnerable components is minimized, enhancing overall security.Using dedicated host machines for the virtualized environment is incorrect. Isolating workloads on separate hosts may reduce certain risks, but it does not address the root cause of vulnerabilities within the images themselves, which a security scanning tool would detect.Monitoring runtime behavior for abnormal activity is incorrect. Runtime monitoring helps detect anomalies and malicious behavior, but it’s reactive. Security scanning prevents vulnerabilities from being introduced into the system in the first place.Enforcing strict network segmentation policies is incorrect.

In this question, Joe has just exploited (leveraged) vulnerabilities. Scoping is your planning stage, collection is your Reconnaissance stage, and summation is your reporting stage. Validation is not a phase of a penetration test, rather it is the confirmation of the vulnerability to ensure it is not a false positive. Therefore, the next step in the process report or summarize the findings. The five phases are as follows:\n1. Planning - agreement on scope of test and rules of engagement with senior management\n2. Information gathering & discovery (recon) - collect information about target environment(s)\n3. Vulnerability scanning - probe for weaknesses\n4. Exploitation - use vulnerabilities to take over system(s)\n5. Reporting - summarize findings along with recommendations\nScoping is incorrect.\nCollection is incorrect.\nValidation is incorrect.",

    "correctAnswerText": "Deploy software to production",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Deploy software to production. Dynamic testing occurs in the validation phase of software development. It involves executing the code to verify that the software behaves as expected and meets client requirements in real-world scenarios. After dynamic testing is successfully completed and the software has been validated, it is ready to be deployed into production or handed over to the client for use.\nTest the software to determine it meets client's expectations is incorrect. This process is part of validation, which has already been completed during dynamic testing. Therefore, this step does not need to be performed next, as Harry has already validated the software to ensure it meets client expectations.\nInspect software for errors is incorrect. Inspecting for errors is part of the verification process, which occurs earlier in the development lifecycle. During verification, code reviews, walkthroughs, and inspections are done to ensure the software is built correctly and follows the design specifications. This step happens before dynamic testing, so it would not come next.\nVerify the software meets specifications is incorrect. Verification ensures that the software is built according to the specified requirements (i.e., building the product right). This step also happens before validation and dynamic testing. Since verification has already been completed, it would not be the next step after dynamic testing.",

The principle of open design states that the security of a mechanism should not depend on the secrecy of its design or implementation. Cory ’s principle is an example of open design. This principle stated that a cryptosystem should be secure, even if everything about the system, except the key, is public knowledge. Because the design is open, there is peer review occurring which provides a more in-depth confirmation process for the validity of the design.\nVulnerabilities are more likely discovered is incorrect. Vulnerabilities may or may not be more easily discovered. Open design would help facilitate the ability for peers to find them, but it doesn’t necessarily equate to that.\nEnables more thorough testing is incorrect. Just because open design is being utilized does not mean that the testing of the design is more thorough.\nCreates a tamper-proof system is incorrect. While the principles of open design can help achieve a more robust system, it is not tamper-proof. Vulnerabilities can occur after a system is implemented via a zero-day or other methods. We cannot eliminate risk, so it is rare that any system (no matter how well built) is tamper-proof.",

Single-loss expectancy is the monetary value expected from the occurrence of a risk on an asset. SLE is mathematically expressed as: Where the exposure factor is represented in the impact of the risk over the asset, or percentage of asset lost.  Asset Value x Exposure Factor = Single Loss Expectancy (impact) E.g. $220M x 60% were destroyed = $12M in losses.Annual Loss Expectancy (ALE) is incorrect. Annualized Loss Expectancy (ALE) is the yearly cost of all instances of a specified threat.Exposure Factor (EF) is incorrect.

By assigning permissions based on user roles rather than individual user accounts, the organization can ensure that employees have access only to the resources necessary for their job functions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.Mandatory access control (MAC) is incorrect. While mandatory access control (MAC) is a strong access control model, it may not be practical for all organizations and could be overly restrictive.Single sign-on (SSO) is incorrect. Single sign-on (SSO) improves user convenience but does not directly enhance security unless combined with other controls.Biometric authentication is incorrect. Biometric authentication adds an extra layer of security but is best utilized alongside RBAC to ensure comprehensive access management.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Utilize a known cryptographic erase method before reselling. The key to this question is finding the right balance between effective data removal and cost efficiency. This option offers strong security through encryption-based erasure while still allowing for the resale of the equipment to recoup some costs.  Encryption-based erasure methods are highly secure, as they render the data unreadable without the encryption key. They're also relatively quick and don't require physical destruction of the drives, allowing for resale. This method is recognized by many security standards as an acceptable form of data sanitization.  \nPerform a complete data overwrite using specialized software, followed by degaussing of the storage devices is incorrect. While this method would be highly effective at removing data, it's overkill and not cost-efficient. Degaussing can render hard drives inoperable, eliminating their resale value. Additionally, performing both overwriting and degaussing is time-consuming and resource-intensive, making it more expensive than necessary.  Lastly, there is no mention if these are hard drives or solid states, the latter of which cannot be degaussed effectively due to lack of magnetic properties.\nExecute multiple overwrites of all data using standard operating system commands is incorrect. This method is not sufficiently secure for sensitive data. Standard operating system commands may not thoroughly overwrite all areas of the drive, potentially leaving some data recoverable. While it's a low-cost option, it doesn't meet the security requirements for a financial institution dealing with sensitive information.\nEmploy encryption-based data erasure, then incinerate the storage devices is incorrect.  While this would be extremely secure, it's not cost-efficient. Physical destruction of the drives (e.g., incineration) eliminates any resale value and incurs additional costs for the destruction process. This level of security is unnecessary if proper encryption-based erasure is performed, making it an overly expensive option.",

It focuses on understanding which elements are essential for business continuity and the impact of their loss on the organization. This aligns with Judy's task of identifying vital components, as a BIA assesses the importance of various business systems and processes, helping to prioritize them for recovery and continuity planning.\nA business continuity plan (BCP) is incorrect. A BCP includes procedures and plans for maintaining and restoring business operations during and after a disaster.

By encrypting sensitive patient information, the organization ensures that only authorized users with the correct decryption keys can access the data, thus safeguarding against potential incidents, unauthorized data mining, and breaches.Ensuring data integrity is incorrect. While encryption does play a role in maintaining data integrity by ensuring that unauthorized changes to data cannot be made without detection, its primary purpose is to protect confidentiality. By transforming plaintext data into ciphertext, encryption ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to those with the appropriate decryption keys. This confidentiality is essential for safeguarding personal, financial, and proprietary information from unauthorized access. In contrast, data integrity is specifically concerned with the accuracy and consistency of data over its lifecycle, which can also be protected through other means such as checksums or hash functions. Thus, while encryption contributes to data integrity, its main function is to secure the confidentiality of the data being protected.Complying with HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) regulations is incorrect. Although encryption is a requirement under HIPAA, the primary benefit is the protection of sensitive data rather than compliance itself.Enhancing system performance is incorrect. Encryption can impact system performance, as it requires additional processing power for both encryption and decryption, making it less efficient rather than enhancing performance.",

    "correctAnswer": "a",
    "correctAnswerText": "Penetration test.",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Penetration test.  A penetration test (pen test) simulates real-world attacks to identify and exploit vulnerabilities within a system. In this scenario, the organization has already experienced a breach and performed remediation. The security consultant was likely hired to determine whether the vulnerability that led to the breach has been properly addressed. A penetration test would involve actively attempting to exploit any remaining vulnerabilities to see if the remediation was successful. The goal is to ensure the weakness that caused the breach cannot be used again, making it the most appropriate choice for this situation.\nThird-party audit. is incorrect. A third-party audit involves an external auditor reviewing an organization’s processes, controls, and compliance with certain standards or regulations. This type of audit is usually requested by an outside party, such as a regulatory body or client, and focuses on ensuring adherence to policies or compliance frameworks, not necessarily on verifying specific technical vulnerabilities or remediations. In this case, since the focus is on checking if a specific vulnerability has been fixed post-breach, an audit wouldn’t be the right method. Audits typically look at broader compliance and control measures, not testing individual vulnerabilities.\nRisk Assessment. is incorrect. A risk assessment evaluates an organization’s potential exposure to various security risks and the impact those risks could have. While a risk assessment helps an organization understand which assets or processes are most vulnerable and the potential consequences of security failures, it doesn't directly test whether specific vulnerabilities have been successfully remediated. The focus of a risk assessment is on identifying and prioritizing risks, rather than verifying the effectiveness of recent remediation efforts.\nVulnerability Scan. is incorrect. A vulnerability scan is a tool-based process that automatically searches for known vulnerabilities in a system or network. While useful for identifying potential security issues, it generally does not attempt to exploit vulnerabilities. In this case, a simple vulnerability scan wouldn’t be sufficient because it wouldn't actively test whether the previously exploited vulnerability has been fully remediated.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Fine-tune the IDS rules to reduce false positives. Fine-tuning the IDS rules is critical for improving its effectiveness. IDS systems rely on signatures and predefined rules to identify potential threats. By adjusting these rules and refining the thresholds for what triggers an alert, the security team can significantly reduce the number of false positives. This allows the system to focus more on genuine threats rather than benign activity, making the security monitoring process more manageable and accurate. Proper tuning also involves removing outdated signatures and adding more precise ones to ensure that the IDS only flags actual risks.Implement threat intelligence feeds to filter out false positives is incorrect. While threat intelligence feeds can provide useful data about emerging threats, they do not directly address the issue of false positives. They may enrich detection capabilities, but the root cause of false positives often lies in improperly configured IDS rules, not in a lack of intelligence data.Perform regular security awareness training for employees is incorrect. Security awareness training is vital for improving employee behavior and reducing social engineering attacks, but it does not have a direct impact on the technical configuration of the IDS. It’s more effective for educating users about phishing or password practices rather than fine-tuning a network monitoring system.Install additional firewalls to block malicious traffic is incorrect. Installing additional firewalls can help block malicious traffic at the perimeter or within network segments, but it won’t enhance the accuracy of the IDS. Firewalls and IDS have distinct roles: firewalls are for traffic control, while IDS is for detecting threats. Fine-tuning the IDS itself is necessary to reduce false positives, not adding more network barriers.",

Establishing a software development lifecycle (SDLC) provides a framework for integrating security at every stage of development, ensuring that security considerations are prioritized from the beginning.Conduct a threat modeling exercise is incorrect. While conducting a threat modeling exercise is beneficial for identifying potential risks, it should occur within the context of an established SDLC.Implement a secure coding standard is incorrect. Implementing secure coding standards is essential but comes after the development process is defined and security practices are integrated into the SDLC.Perform penetration testing on the application is incorrect.

    "correctAnswerText": "23",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: 23. Port 23. Port 23 is commonly utilized by Telnet to provide remote connectivity and administration of servers. However, Telnet does not encrypt either the authentication credentials or the transmissions themselves, and are therefore a significant risk to eavesdropping or sniffing. Further, the question mentions a web server so while risky, it is not uncommon to have port 80 open, so it is not the GREATEST risk out of the choices.\n80 is incorrect.  Although Port 80 (HTTP) is unencrypted and poses some risk (especially if sensitive data is transmitted without HTTPS), it is commonly used for web traffic. Many organizations still need to keep HTTP open for compatibility or legacy reasons, even if it means exposing some degree of risk. In practice, organizations often try to mitigate this risk by redirecting users to HTTPS for secure communication, but having Port 80 open is not inherently as risky as an unsecured remote access protocol like Telnet.\n443 is incorrect.  Port 443 (HTTPS) is used for encrypted web traffic. It ensures that all data exchanged between the client and the server is encrypted, making it difficult for attackers to intercept. It is a crucial component of secure web services, and closing it would essentially disable encrypted web traffic, which would be counterproductive for a web server.\n22 is incorrect.  Port 22 (SSH) is used for Secure Shell (SSH), which provides encrypted remote login and other secure network services. Unlike Telnet, SSH encrypts both the login process and all subsequent data transmissions, significantly reducing the risk of unauthorized interception. Although SSH can be a target for brute force attacks, its strong encryption mechanisms make it a far safer choice than Telnet for remote administration.",

Configuring firewall rules is essential to specify which types of traffic are allowed or blocked. For example, allowing traffic on port 443 (for HTTPS) while blocking port 80 (for HTTP) helps ensure that encrypted communications are prioritized, enhancing security.Performing penetration testing to evaluate the firewall's effectiveness is incorrect. Penetration testing is a separate process used to evaluate the effectiveness of security measures but is not directly related to initial firewall configuration.Implementing encryption to protect the data being transmitted is incorrect. Encryption is critical for securing data in transit but is a separate layer of security from firewall configuration. Firewalls primarily manage traffic flow.Creating audit logs to monitor user activity is incorrect. While audit logs are important for monitoring and post-event analysis, configuring firewall rules to control network traffic is a more direct action for securing the network.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Discretionary Access Control (DAC). DAC is where the owner determines who has access to the data and what privileges they have. The data owner has the power to determine who can (and cannot) access the data based on the business requirements and constraints affecting the owner. While the owner never has the ability to ignore, or contradict the organization’s access control policies, he or she has the ability to interpret those policies to fit the specific needs of his or her system and his or her users.Non-Discretionary Access Control (NDAC) is incorrect. NDAC is based on the assignment of permissions to read, write, and execute files on a system. However, unlike discretionary access controls, which allow the file owner to specify permissions, non-discretionary access control requires the administrator of a system to define and tightly control the access rules for files in the system.RuBAC (Rule-Based access control) is incorrect. RuBAC is where access is based on a list of predefined rules that determine what access should be granted. The rules, created or authorized by system owners, specify the privileges granted to users, such as, read, write, and execute, when the specific condition of a rule is met. Rule-based controls are most commonly a form of DAC, because the system owner typically develops the rules based on organization or processing needs.Content-Dependent Access controls is incorrect. Content-Dependent Access Control restricts access to data based on the content of the object.",

ACL’s lack centralization which can make managing them somewhat more difficult when there are a large number of employees. The auditing function is not expensive to maintain, there is separation amongst users with ACLs, and ACLs are not operating system specific.\nACL’s have an auditing function that is expensive to maintain is incorrect.  ACLs do not inherently include an expensive auditing function. While some implementations may offer logging or auditing features, this is not a defining feature of ACLs, and it's not generally considered costly. Auditing is typically an additional layer that can be added but is not part of the basic ACL functionality. Therefore, it doesn't represent a primary disadvantage of ACLs.\nThere is no separation amongst users is incorrect.  ACLs do provide user-level control and separation. One of the core functions of ACLs is that they allow administrators to specify which users or groups have access to certain resources, such as files or systems, at different levels of permissions (read, write, execute, etc.). Therefore, ACLs do support user separation, which is essential for role-based access control (RBAC).\nACLs are limited to specific operating systems is incorrect.  ACLs are used across a variety of operating systems, including both Windows and Unix-based systems (Linux, macOS). While the syntax and implementation details may vary between different systems, ACLs themselves are not restricted to a specific operating system. Therefore, this is not considered a primary disadvantage of ACLs.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Each binary bit of the ciphertext is interrelated which obfuscates relationships of the plaintext and the cipher text.. Confusion is essentially where the relationship between the ciphertext and the key is hidden. Confusion in block ciphers refers to obscuring the relationship between the plaintext and ciphertext. The goal is to make it difficult for an attacker to determine the key even if they have access to both the plaintext and its corresponding ciphertext. By ensuring that each binary bit of the ciphertext is interrelated with others, it becomes harder to deduce patterns or relationships between the plaintext and ciphertext, which strengthens the encryption.\nConcealment of the ciphertext by modifying polyalphabetic ciphers to the plaintext is incorrect. Polyalphabetic ciphers are substitution ciphers that use multiple alphabets to conceal plaintext. While they add complexity, this choice doesn't accurately describe the concept of confusion in modern block ciphers, as it focuses on historical cipher techniques rather than how confusion obfuscates relationships in the ciphertext.\nModification of a single bit of the plaintext results in a variation of the associated ciphertext. is incorrect. This is diffusion, not confusion. Diffusion ensures that small changes in the plaintext (e.g., modifying a single bit) result in significant changes in the ciphertext, typically affecting many bits.\nReplaces plaintext with established replacements using randomization is incorrect. This description is more aligned with substitution or potentially randomized ciphers, but it does not correctly capture the nature of confusion in block ciphers, where the focus is on obfuscating the relationship between plaintext and ciphertext, not simply replacing it with random values.",

Mandatory Vacations are used primarily to detect activity pertaining to specific people and events occurring simultaneously. For example, the network bandwidth is always peaking when Bob is in the office. When he isn’t, it’s not. A mandatory vacation can be used to check if perhaps Bob is doing something he shouldn’t, or something he is unaware of.\nLeast Privilege is incorrect. Least privilege is an access control method which is used as a preventative control to ensure users only have access to what they need to perform their duties. It would not be a detective control.\nDefense in Depth is incorrect. Defense in depth is essentially a “backup” of controls. For example, let's say you have a locked door that requires a key to open. With Defense in depth, you would have a locked door, and inside the door another method like biometrics in case one control fails or is no longer effective, you have another to assist in providing protection.\nSeparation of Duties is incorrect. Separation of duties are administrative controls meant to limit access just to individuals or groups who are responsible for that task or function.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Unauthorized accounts that have access to a SCADA (supervisory control and data acquisition) with weak passwords, which connects to a nuclear centrifuge.. Unauthorized access to a SCADA could/would potentially cause grave damage affecting human life. Protection of human life should always be at the forefront of any business decision.\nUser accounts that have not been logged into in six months. is incorrect. While 6 months is a long time, there could be various plausible reasoning for it. Users could be on Family Medical Leave, account could be inactive/disabled, could be an account used for a specific function. For additional security, it would be advised to implement a policy/procedure to ensure accounts that are not used frequently are locked after a certain period of time. Even so, this would not be the greatest risk.\nAccounts with privileged access to the bastion host. is incorrect. These could be legitimate accounts that need the access. Privileged accounts are not out of the ordinary in most environments.\nAccounts that have had gradual accumulation of access due to disparate organizational changes. is incorrect. This is an issue for sure, but it is not as big of an issue as unauthorized accounts on a SCADA. This is the second-best answer here.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Mitigation. Mitigation is the most appropriate risk response for handling residual risk, especially when dealing with a vital component that stores customer PII (Personally Identifiable Information). Residual risk is the remaining risk after controls have been implemented. Mitigation involves taking additional measures to reduce the likelihood or impact of this residual risk to an acceptable level. In this case, further strengthening security controls, such as encryption, access controls, or monitoring, would be essential to protect sensitive customer data.Avoidance is incorrect. Risk avoidance involves eliminating the risk entirely by not engaging in the activity that generates the risk. However, in this scenario, avoiding the risk might not be feasible since the component is vital to the company's operations. Avoidance might mean not using the component at all, which could disrupt business functions.Acceptance is incorrect. Risk acceptance means acknowledging the risk without taking further action to reduce it, typically when the cost of mitigation outweighs the benefit. Given the sensitivity of customer PII, simply accepting the residual risk without additional protective measures would likely be inappropriate and could expose the company to legal and financial liabilities.Transfer is incorrect. Risk transfer involves shifting the risk to a third party, such as through insurance or outsourcing. While this could be an option, it doesn't reduce the actual risk to the PII itself and could still leave the company vulnerable if the third party fails to manage the risk effectively.",

    "correctAnswerText": "Establish a formal vendor evaluation framework",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Establish a formal vendor evaluation framework. Establishing a formal vendor evaluation framework provides a structured approach to assess and ensure compliance with security policies effectively. This framework enables the organization to systematically evaluate each vendor's risk profile, security practices, and adherence to regulatory requirements. By defining specific criteria for vendor selection, the institution can prioritize relationships with those that meet or exceed security expectations. This structured approach allows for ongoing monitoring and reassessment, fostering a culture of accountability and proactive risk management.Increase the frequency of compliance audits is incorrect. While increasing the frequency of compliance audits can enhance oversight and provide additional insights into vendor practices, it does not create a comprehensive evaluation mechanism. Relying solely on audits may lead to reactive measures instead of proactive strategies that address compliance issues before they arise. Additionally, frequent audits may strain resources without fundamentally improving the overall vendor management process.Develop a vendor training program on security policies is incorrect. Although developing a vendor training program on security policies can significantly enhance vendors’ understanding of compliance requirements and best practices, it does not directly address the need for systematic oversight of vendor compliance. Training alone may not ensure that vendors implement the necessary security measures or adhere to policies consistently, especially if there is no structured evaluation to monitor compliance.Require vendors to submit regular risk assessments is incorrect. Requiring vendors to submit regular risk assessments is a valuable practice, as it allows the organization to gain insights into the vendor's security posture and identify potential vulnerabilities. However, without a formal evaluation framework in place, these assessments may not be comprehensive or uniformly assessed against the organization’s specific compliance standards. Consequently, this measure alone may not ensure consistent compliance with security policies across all vendors.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Modification of a single bit of the plaintext results in widespread changes across the ciphertext.  Diffusion means that if we change a single bit of the plaintext, then half of the bits in the ciphertext should change, and vice versa (if ciphertext changes, then plaintext should as well).\nConcealment of the ciphertext by modifying polyalphabetic ciphers to the plaintext is incorrect.  his option refers to historical encryption techniques, specifically polyalphabetic substitution ciphers, which use multiple alphabets to obscure plaintext. Although these techniques add complexity, they are not relevant to the modern cryptographic concept of diffusion. Diffusion ensures that small changes in the plaintext ripple through the ciphertext, whereas polyalphabetic ciphers focus on direct substitution to conceal plaintext patterns.\nEach binary bit of the ciphertext is interrelated which obfuscates relationships of the plaintext and the cipher text is incorrect.  This option describes confusion, not diffusion. Confusion ensures that the relationship between the encryption key and the ciphertext is obscured, making it challenging for attackers to deduce the encryption key even if they have access to the plaintext and ciphertext. While confusion is a critical property of secure block ciphers, it does not address the spreading effect of small changes in the plaintext on the ciphertext, which is the hallmark of diffusion.\nReplaces plaintext with established replacements using randomization is incorrect.  This describes substitution, a process in which parts of the plaintext are replaced with other values, either predefined or randomized. While substitution can contribute to obfuscating the plaintext, it does not capture the essence of diffusion. Diffusion focuses on spreading the influence of a single change in the plaintext across the entire ciphertext, whereas substitution operates locally, replacing specific parts of the plaintext.",

During the information gathering and discovery phase, identifying services running on the target systems is crucial. This allows Joshua to understand the attack surface, determine what services are accessible, and start mapping potential vulnerabilities.  \nThere are five phases of penetration testing.  They are as follows:\n    i. Planning - agreement on scope of test and rules of engagement with senior management\n    ii. Information gathering & discovery (recon) - collect information about target environment(s)\n    iii. Vulnerability scanning - probe for weaknesses\n    iv. Exploitation - use vulnerabilities to take over system(s)\n    v. Reporting - summarize findings along with recommendations\nSource:  Adam Gordon – Author of ISC2 CBK v4.\nEncapsulate solution is incorrect.  This is not the correct next step at this stage. Encapsulating  solution refers to summarizing or packaging findings into a solution, which is more appropriate toward the end of the penetration testing process, during or after the reporting phase. Joshua should first identify vulnerabilities and exploit them before moving to recommendations or solutions.\nLeverage findings is incorrect.   This would occur after vulnerabilities are identified during the scanning and discovery process. \"Leveraging findings\" suggests Joshua would act on identified weaknesses, likely in the exploitation phase, which comes after vulnerability analysis. At this stage, Joshua is still gathering information and identifying services, so it's too early to leverage findings.\nLocate deficiencies is incorrect.  Locating deficiencies is an important part of the vulnerability scanning and analysis phase, which comes after Joshua identifies the services running on the target environment. While this step is essential, it is premature at this stage, as Joshua hasn't yet identified what services are running and what vulnerabilities may exist.",

Sandboxes are often used to isolate the code while testing. Synthetic Transactions are also often used to verify system performance by executing a script that will produce known, or expected results. DAST is also sometimes referred to as “black box testing” or “play testing.” DAST should be performed in a test environment that mimics the production environment but that is completely isolated from it.

    "correctAnswerText": "Encrypting data at rest and in transit",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Encrypting data at rest and in transit.  Encrypting sensitive data both at rest (when it’s stored) and in transit (when it’s being transmitted) is the most effective way to ensure confidentiality and protection against unauthorized access. In a healthcare setting, sensitive patient information is highly regulated, and encryption provides an essential layer of security by making the data unreadable to anyone who does not have the correct decryption key. This approach safeguards patient information even if the data is intercepted during transmission or accessed from storage.\nImplementing mobile device management (MDM) is incorrect. While Mobile Device Management (MDM) strengthens device security by controlling access and enforcing policies, it does not specifically secure the data itself. MDM is more effective for managing and securing devices rather than protecting the confidentiality of data, which encryption directly addresses.\nRequiring strong passwords for access is incorrect. Strong passwords enhance user authentication but do not protect data after access has been granted. Encryption, on the other hand, ensures that the data remains protected even if an authorized account is compromised, adding a critical layer of security for sensitive information.\nApplying regular security patches is incorrect. Patching helps fix known vulnerabilities, reducing the likelihood of attacks. However, encryption directly protects the sensitive health data, securing it against unauthorized access regardless of system vulnerabilities. Therefore, while patches are necessary, they do not serve the same primary purpose of protecting data confidentiality as encryption does.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Protecting the training data.  Protecting training data is the highest priority because it ensures the AI system's integrity, reliability, and security. A compromised dataset leads to faulty fraud detection, making the AI ineffective or even harmful. While real-time monitoring, bias management, and privacy are essential considerations, they do not outweigh the foundational risk of training data manipulation.\nImplementing real-time monitoring is incorrect. While real-time monitoring helps detect fraud in action, it does not prevent an attacker from poisoning the AI at its core. If the model is already compromised due to manipulated training data, real-time monitoring might miss fraudulent activities altogether.\nManaging model bias is incorrect. Bias can lead to discriminatory practices and regulatory concerns, but it does not directly impact the security of AI operations. A biased model may be problematic, but a poisoned model is outright dangerous.\nEnsuring user data privacy is incorrect. AI privacy concerns involve protecting personally identifiable information (PII) and transaction data, but if the AI model itself is corrupted, privacy controls won’t prevent fraud or system compromise. A secure AI model naturally supports data privacy, but privacy controls alone won’t stop attacks on AI integrity.",

Archiving happens after data is no longer actively used but must still be kept in a secure, often less accessible location, for potential future needs. In the data lifecycle, archival occurs before data is completely removed or deleted, making it a critical step in managing information assets.\nLabeling is incorrect. While labeling is an important part of the data lifecycle, it is done early in the process. It involves assigning metadata or tags to information assets to identify their classification, such as \"confidential\" or \"public.\" Labeling happens when the data is created or collected, not just before removal.\nMarking is incorrect. Similar to labeling, marking is used to indicate the classification of an information asset based on its sensitivity. It ensures that the data is handled appropriately, following its classification. This process typically occurs when the data is first created or processed, rather than at the end of its lifecycle before removal.\nBackups is incorrect. Backups are part of the data protection strategy. They involve creating a copy of the data to ensure its availability in case of system failure, data corruption, or other issues. Unlike archival, which is for long-term storage of inactive data, backups are designed to ensure continuity and retention of active data during its lifecycle. Both the original and backup copies are kept, and backups are not part of the process of data removal.",

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Tom implements VLANs and stages router ACLs. VLANs are designed to enable the separation of traffic between multiple networks passing through a single switch. The staged firewall ACLs would allow quick isolation of a given subnet by denying traffic to or from that subnet.Tom implements 802.1x is incorrect. 802.1x authenticates a user's identity and authorizes access to the network.Tom enables and hardens the host-based firewall on every company asset is incorrect. Configuration changes to host-based assets takes time to roll out (not meeting the quick requirement), and has a time delta between a shut-down host being started up and receiving an updated \"isolation\" firewall policy.Tom implements Kerberos and disables NTLM is incorrect. Both Kerberos and NTLM are authentication mechanisms, and provide no network-based access controls in isolation.",

Don’t get held up on verbiage too much. An assessor would assess (as would an auditor), and an appraisal is a review, and does not necessarily have to deal with money.\nReview Standards to ensure they properly adhere to Policies is incorrect. While reviewing standards is a good choice, the review is not a direct action to verify compliance.\nModify and implement new policies to comply with standards. is incorrect.

    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Iris scan. The colored portion of the eye that surrounds the pupil is used to establish identity or provide authentication is an Iris scan. Iris scans are highly accurate, quick, and less invasive compared to retina scans, making them a more practical, privacy-respecting solution for biometric authentication.\nSynchronous security token is incorrect. Synchronous tokens are time-synchronized with an authentication server to generate a One-Time Password (OTP). These tokens and the server operate with independent clocks that must be synchronized to the same time base. The OTP generated is valid only for a short time. If the clocks between the token and the authentication server drift too far apart, the OTP will fail, and authentication will not be successful.  While synchronous tokens enhance authentication security, they are not biometric solutions because they do not rely on a user’s unique physical or behavioral characteristics (e.g., fingerprints, facial recognition, retina scans, or voice patterns). Instead, they rely on time-based cryptographic algorithms to generate OTPs.  Biometric solutions, on the other hand, are based on measurable, inherent traits of a person that are virtually impossible to replicate, making them distinct from token-based mechanisms. Synchronous tokens, therefore, do not leverage any biological data and instead depend solely on cryptographic synchronization.\nRetina scan is incorrect. A retina scan is a laser scan of the capillaries that feed the retina of the back of the eye. The user needs to press their eye up to the last scanner eyecup and may raise privacy issues due to conditions such as diabetes and pregnancy. Due to the need for proximity bodily fluids can be exchanged.\nHand geometry is incorrect. Measurements are taken from specific points on the subject’s hands – length, width, thickness, surface area.  While less invasive, hand geometry is not as accurate as iris scans and is also becoming less commonly used due to technological advancements.",

Data Acquisition: acquiring already existing data which has been produced outside the\norganization.\nB. Data Entry: manual entry of new data by personnel within the organization\nC. Data Capture: capture of data generated by devices used in various processes in the organization.\n2. Storage - Once data has been created within the organization, it needs to be stored and protected, with the appropriate level of security applied, which includes classifying it for easy retrieval and determining access controls. For example, files can be marked as “internal” or “external,” which then decides how tight of a lid it needs to be kept under.\n3. Usage - Data is used to support activities in the organization. Data can be viewed, processed, modified and saved.\n4. Archival - The copying of data to an environment where it is stored in case it is needed again in an active production environment, and the removal of this data from all active production environments.\na. A data archive is simply a place where data is stored, but where no maintenance or general usage occurs. If necessary, the data can be restored to an environment where it can be used.\n5. Destruction - Data destruction or purging is the removal of every copy of a data item from an organization. It is typically done from an archive storage location. – Source:  Adam Gordon – Author of ISC2 CBK v4.\nCreation is incorrect.\nStorage is incorrect.\nArchival is incorrect.",

    "correctAnswerText": "Policies have not been updated for more than a year",
    "fullExplanation": "Correct Answer: Policies have not been updated for more than a year. Bath Company Incorporated is a European company, which requires it to be in compliance with GDPR. Policies that have not been updated in a year is not a requirement of GDPR. Further, Policies are generally not updated yearly, as they constitute a high-level document outlining business requirements.Lack of encryption of PII (personal identifiable information) is incorrect. The lack of encryption of PII (personal identifiable information) would be a concern.  PII should always be protected as you run the risk of falling out of compliance with GDPR which includes a hefty fine.  Any breach of PII is required to be reported within 72 hours under GDPR regulations.Lack of a retention policy for data is incorrect. GDPR specifically requires an appropriate policy retention for all data.  Purging data too soon could create issues should It need to be accessed.  Keeping it too long could create additional risk, and additional costs as the data would require protection.There has not been a comprehensive risk assessment performed is incorrect. GDPR requires a comprehensive risk assessment to be in compliance.  Any organization that’s required to comply with the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) must conduct regular risk assessments.  Risk assessments are essential for effective cyber security, helping organizations address problems that could cause irreparable harm.",

Thomas is concerned with trusted or authorized actors which would be internal staff. An internal audit is performed by a team from within the organization, usually meant for internal consumption; generally, concentrate on the controls that are associated with authorized and trusted actors (employees and other users such as contractors) and the threats that may stem from misuse of resources.External is incorrect. An external audit is performed by an outside auditing firm not connected with the organization; focus on threats posed by external actors that seek unauthorized access to organizational resources.Third-party is incorrect. A third-party audit is conducted by and/or on behalf of another organization, such as a regulatory body; usually arranged to augment or provide auxiliary support to internal/external testing methodologies retained within an organization. Third-party assessments also provide the highest level of assurance of assessment independence.SOC is incorrect. A SOC report is issued after a third-party auditor conducts a thorough examination of an organization to verify that they have an effective system of controls related to security, confidentiality, integrity and availability.",

It is widely used for large volumes of data and complies with many regulatory standards.\nRSA-4096 (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman, 4096-bit) is incorrect.  RSA is an asymmetric encryption method, typically used for key exchanges, but it is slower than AES for encrypting large data sets.\nDES (Data Encryption Standard) is incorrect.   DES is considered insecure due to its short key length and can be broken easily, making it unsuitable for modern encryption needs.\nBlowfish is incorrect.  Blowfish is a symmetric block cipher that is fast and secure, especially for smaller data sets. It allows for key sizes ranging from 32 to 448 bits, providing flexibility. However, Blowfish has not been adopted as widely as AES and does not benefit from the same level of standardization or hardware optimization. Additionally, Blowfish can be less efficient for very large data sets compared to AES, which is why AES-256 is preferred in modern high-volume environments like financial services.",
